# Shovel Server

## Overview
Shovel is an application that provides a service with a set of APIs that wraps around RackHD/Ironicâ€™s existing APIs.  It allows users to find Baremetal the compute nodes that were dynamically discovered by RackHD. In addition, it enables the user to register/unregister the nodes with Ironic (OpenStack Bare Metal Provisioning Program).Shovel also provides poller service that monitors compute nodes and logs the errors from SEL into the Ironic Database.
A Shovel Horizon plugin is also provided to interface with the Shovel service. The plugin adds a new Panel to the admin Dashboard called rackhd that displays a table of all the Baremetal systems discovered by RackHD. It also allows the user to see the node catalog in a nice table View, Register/Unregister node in Ironic, display node SEL and enable/register a failover node.
